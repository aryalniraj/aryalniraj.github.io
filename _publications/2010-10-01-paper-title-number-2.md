This paper is about experimental observation of the photoinduced anisotropic lattice distortion and domain formation in thermoelectric material SnSe performed in collaboration with Ultrafast Electron Diffraction (UED) group at Brookhaven National Laboratory.
Our contributions in this paper was providing theoretical insights for how such domains could possibly formed in ultrafast experiments.
For this, we performed phonon calculations and lattice relaxation calculations at different electronic temperature to mimic the effect of lattice thermalization during the ultrafast experiments where non-equilibrium distribution of electrons and holes are formed. Our DFT-based simulations shed light on which phonon modes are excited during such process and suggests a mechanism of domain formation.

This paper is the continuation of the work we did last  year about phonon-induced Dirac semimetal formaion in ZrTe5. In this work, we study the formation of dynamical Weyl phases using inversion symmetry breaking IR phonon modes. We find that depending on the type of mirror symmteries broken by the IR modes, the position of the Weyl nodes in the momentum space can be controlled. In adition, such symmetry breaking perturbations have consequences in the  Berry curvature related transport properties..
